If no round is in progress
    - AI's boot and sent a POST request to register for the next round
    - Once at minimum 2 AI's have registered, a 1 minute countdown begins (overrideable)
    - During this 1 minute, other AI's can continue to register
    - Once round has begun, all registered snakes are randomly placed on the field
    - Field size is determined randomly
    - Apple is randomly placed on the field
    - Server will now request moves from the snakes and play the game until 1 snake is left alive
